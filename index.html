                <h1>
                    Android Mascot History 
                </h1>
                <p>You probably know that the <strong>Android</strong> operating system, powered by <strong>Google</strong> is one of the most used for mobile devices worldwide. But maybe you don't know that your friendly pet has a name and a very curious history? Well, follow this article to learn a lot about this little robot.</p></p>

                <h2>The first version</h2>
                <p>The first attempt at creating a mascot came in 2007 and came from a developer named <a href="https://www.thedrum.com/news/2013/01/06/googles-dan-morrill-reveals-rejected-android-mascot-designs" target="_blank" class="externo">Dan Morrill</a>. He says that he opened <a href="https://inkscape.org/" target="_blank" class="externo">Inkscape</a> (free software for vectorizing images) and created his own version of a robot. The goal was just to personify the system just for his team, there was no request from the company to create a mascot.</p>

                    <img src="imagens/dan-droids.png" alt="Primeiro mascote do android">

                <p>This first bizarre version was even named after its creator: they would be the <strong>Dandroids</strong>.</p>

                <h2>A new pet appears</h2>

                <p>The idea of having a mascot matured and the mission was passed on to a professional in the area. The Russian illustrator <a href="https://www.irinablok.com/" target="_blank" class="externo">Irina Blok</a> , also a Google employee, was given the mission to represent the little robot in a more pleasant way.</p>

                    <source media="(max-width:670px" srcset="imagens/irina-blok-pq.jpg">
                    <img src="imagens/irina-blok.jpg" alt="">
                </picture>

                <p>Irina's main idea was to represent everything graphically with few strokes and in a flatter way. The drawing should also generate quick identification with the viewer. Then came <strong>Bugdroid</strong>, Android's new mascot.</p>

                    <p>Another curious thing about Android is that each version has always been named after a candy, in alphabetical order from version 1.5 to 9.0.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Cupcake</li>
                        <li>Donut</li>
                        <li>Eclair</li>
                        <li>Froyo</li>
                        <li>Gingerbread</li>
                        <li>Honeycomb</li>
                        <li>Ice Cream Sandwich</li>
                        <li>Jelly Bean</li>
                        <li>KitKat</li>
                        <li>Lolipop</li>
                        <li>Marshmallow</li>
                        <li>Nougat</li>
                        <li>Oreo</li>
                        <li>Pie</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Unfortunately, the <strong>Android Q </strong> did not exist, as Google decided to put an end to this fun practice and started using numbers, which gave rise to Android 10.</p>

                    <p>visit the website <a href="https://www.android.com/intl/en_uk/history/#/donut" target="_blank" class="externo">Android History</a> to see the sequence of "sweetened" versions and what each one brought to the Android system.</p>
