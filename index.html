                    Android Mascot History 
                </h1>
                <p>You probably know that the <strong>Android</strong> operating system, powered by <strong>Google</strong> is one of the most used for mobile devices worldwide. But maybe you don't know that your friendly pet has a name and a very curious history? Well, follow this article to learn a lot about this little robot.</p></p>

                <h2>The first version</h2>
                <p>The first attempt at creating a mascot came in 2007 and came from a developer named <a href="https://www.thedrum.com/news/2013/01/06/googles-dan-morrill-reveals-rejected-android-mascot-designs" target="_blank">Dan Morrill</a>. He says that he opened <a href="https://inkscape.org/" target="_blank">Inkscape</a> (free software for vectorizing images) and created his own version of a robot. The goal was just to personify the system just for his team, there was no request from the company to create a mascot.</p>
